###5 fundamental points to learn how to manage aggressive behaviour###

<br><br>
####The context####
**What is our working environment?**<br>
Are we going to be attacked in a tatami or ring by a complacent opponent?
> No. So don't choose these techniques. They are inappropriate because they are too much or too little "effective".

####The emergency####
**When will the next attack take place?**<br>
How much time do we have to prepare and maintain a suitable technical level?
> Specialized units have difficulty training twice a week. And you?

####The human capital####
**Who is my team?**<br>
How many of us are there? The average age? The level of fitness? The turns?
> You may have an athlete in the team along with Martine, 52 years old and Guy, black belt of lasagna...

####The legal framework####
**What can we do legally?**<br>
What is our function? Who do we want to be at the ethical and human level?
> The function, the uniform and the mission limit the field of possibilities. A policeman and a nurse don't have the same arsenal.
