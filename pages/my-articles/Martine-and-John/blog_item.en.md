## What do a nurse, a fireman and a teacher have in common?

* They serve people
* Violence should not be part of their job
* They are the target of violent behaviours


We could sell some magic self-defense techniques and make them believe that will solve the problem.

## but then, what do you think would happen?

* They all have very little time for training

### The nurse
* She weights 50kg and she is 1.60m tall. Her patient is an young male of 1.80m and 85 kg.
* She will not even dare to use it.

### The fireman
* He is super-fit and could apply all the techniques.
* His problem is 50-years old and has lost everything he had.
* Violent techniques are not applicable.

### The teacher
* He is yound but not a sport guy.
* He teaches teenagers who are bigger than him.
* Rather than harming one of them, he will take that punch in his face.
