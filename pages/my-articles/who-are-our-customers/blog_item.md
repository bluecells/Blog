* They serve people
* Violence should not be part of their job
* They are the target of violent behaviours

We could sell some magic self-defense techniques and make them believe that will solve the problem (knowing that all have very little time for training).

### **But then, what do you think would happen?**  
<br>
#### The nurse
* She weights 50kg and she is 1.60m tall. Her patient is an young male of 1.80m and 85 kg.
* She will not even dare to use it.

<br>
#### The fireman
* He is super-fit and could apply all the techniques.
* His problem is 50-years old and has lost everything he had.
* Violent techniques are not applicable.

<br>
#### The teacher
* He is young but not really a sport guy.
* He teaches teenagers who are bigger than him.
* Rather than harming one of them, he prefers to take that punch in the face.

However, the Nurse could learn **Team-Work**, the Fireman **Adjustable Control and Restraint tools** and the Teacher **Protection skills**.
